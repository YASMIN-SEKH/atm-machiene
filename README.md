Usage:
1. The user can check their balance by choosing option 1.
2. To deposit money, the user selects option 2 and enters the deposit amount.
3. For withdrawals, the user chooses option 3 and enters the withdrawal amount.
4. The user can exit the ATM by selecting option 4.

Note:
1. The program uses a simple float variable to represent the account balance. In a real-world scenario, it's common to use data types like double for representing currency due to higher precision.
2. This code does not incorporate error handling extensively (e.g., non-numeric inputs), and in a production environment, additional validation would be necessary.
3. It's a console-based program, so interactions occur through text input and output in the terminal.
4.Overall, this code provides a basic structure for an ATM simulation, suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex ATM systems.
